# My Power BI

As a data analytics intern, I perform data analysis and visualization using Microsoft Power BI at work.
Besides that, I do projects and join challenges to sharpen Power BI skills at my free time.

In this repository, I share reports and dashboards that I made or remade based on the requirements of challenges in the Workout Wednesday event.
